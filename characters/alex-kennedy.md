## History

Tom and Emily met on a grift conning the same mark for different reasons. They decided to team up and fell in love while doing so.  They grifted together for three years before Emily became with child. Tom went on a grift conning a man out of his inheritance.The man was connected to the mob and Tom paid for his dishonesty with cement boots and bullet to the brain. Emily ran from the state and kept on moving and griftng while pregnant.  After Alex was born she kept drifting Taking her son with her all the while.  [Tom was killed by Poet's minions]

Emily used Alex in her grifts from the beginning's.  First as the child she was saving to when he was older and part of the con.  He played the dying kid shaving his head and starving himself for days to look sickly.

At the age of 5 Alex came into his telepathy.  His mother taught him how to shut out the other thoughts and voices.  But at age 7 a new talent developed and he found himself in the dream of a small brown eyed boy who was pretending to be a monster and crashing through towers of blocks.  It happened every night before he finally told his mom.  

Emily took Alex to a shaman who taught him how to control both his telepathy and his dream walking.  But every night Alex visited to small boy playing monster until a year later when the boy was ripped from the dream screaming.  Alex tried to find the boy but it was futile.  Still every night he met with the same little boy.  No matter how old Alex got the boy stayed the same.  Alex figured that it wasn't a real boy since he never aged over the years and went through the motions watching the boy destroy the block city and the get ripped away screaming.   It was always a challenge to see if he could release himself from it early or change the dream at all.

At 13 he had his first sexual experience while on a con with a woman of immense wealth who had a preference for young boys. On one con his mother failed to pick up the mark because he was gay.  Alex was 16 but succeeded where his mother had failed and found men as enjoyable as women.

Shortly before his 17th birthday Emily died in a car crash.  It was a suspected homicide but the culprit was never caught. Alex was supposed to have been with his mother but the con he was working pulled a surprise visit and he didn't join his mother to clean out the bank accounts at the end of their con. [Someone was trying to kill Alex to avoid prophecy.]

Alex continued to grift and drift through the US on various identities doing various odd jobs to make money on the side.  He never stayed in any one place too long.  Never made attachments.

The only relationships Alex had were business related.  Id's, papers, clothes and anything else he might need.  He also had connections with organizations who wanted covert information.  We worked regularly for the ccb as an informant but he'd work for whoever had the best price.  

Alex is currently working as a bartender at a club called Aspect and pulling information from unsuspecting clients in the club.  Sometimes the info drunk millenials had was actually worth some money.  Aspect was teaming with blackmail and grifts.  He had been in New York City for six months and counting probably the longest he had ever stayed in one place.

A bit on Alex's motives...  
so at the start, Nox is a job, get the info and get out right? And he's easy enough to read so it should be an easy enough thing to do. But there's the dream, Alex is going to have to follow up on that, why was this kid in my dream? Was it really him? Then the job is still going because what Alex got (maybe how Nox doesn't agree with the Venatori way) Poet already knew, he's looking for more or for a way to use Nox... Got to get closer, get deeper. He's wary because Nox is Venatori, the enemy, yet he's so charming, not nice exactly, but he can insult someone with a grin and get away with it. Has a snarky side that Alex finds amusing and a good sense of humour, he admires the player. And under it, he likes the fact that Nox is happy to break the rules to do what's right since that's a bit of a thing for Alex too, kindred spirits ther. Then there's the physical appeal, why not scratch an itch? Then in typical mark fashion he sees the benefits, the cooking, the sex, the inner track to all things Venatori, might as well stick around, play it for all he can. Meanwhile, he's falling in love, looking forward to spending time with Nox, talking about whatever, not realising he's not on the game, not pumping for information all the time, cancelling plans with other marks, tells himself it's because Nox is important to Poet... I think he'd use that excuse quite a bit...
